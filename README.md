# Task 01 – Movie Rating Distribution

## Internship
SkillCraft Technology – Data Science Internship

## Objective
The objective of this task is to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable using a bar chart. This task focuses on understanding how data visualization helps in analyzing and interpreting real-world datasets.

## Dataset Description
The dataset represents movie ratings grouped into four categories:
- Poor (0–2)
- Average (2–3)
- Good (3–4)
- Excellent (4–5)

Each category indicates the number of movies falling within the specified rating range.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Visualization Description
A bar chart is used to represent the distribution of movies across different rating categories.  
- X-axis: Rating Categories  
- Y-axis: Number of Movies  

This visualization makes it easy to compare movie counts across rating levels.

## Outcome
Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Data visualization using Python
- Representing categorical data effectively
- Extracting insights from visual representations

## Conclusion
The movie rating distribution chart provides a clear overview of how movies are rated, helping to identify trends and overall quality distribution.
